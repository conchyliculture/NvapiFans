# NvapiFans

Control external fans (ie: connected via the FanConnect headers) on ASUS ROG Strix 2070 Super.

Might work on other ASUS graphic cards.

## Installation / Usage

See relevant documents per platform:
  * [Linux](linux/README.md) (Kind of works, but you'll have to send i2c commands on your own)
  * [Windows](win/README.md) (WiP, almost done)

### config.json

For the win & linux services, you can use a `config.json` file to set configuration values.
The default values and what they mean are as such:
```
{
    "version": 1,
    "gpu_config": {
        "interval_s": 2,     // The frequency at which the service checks the GPU temperature and adjusts the fan speed.
                            // Seconds, range 1 - 30
        "min_temp_c": 40,    // At this temperature or lower, the service will run the fan at min_fan_speed.
                            // Celsius, range 0 - 100
        "max_temp_c": 80,    // At this temperature or higher, the service will run the fan at max_fan_speed.
                            // Celsius, range 0 - 100
        "min_fan_start_speed": 35,  // When the fan is stopped, this is the minimum speed at which the fan will start spinning.
                                    // Range 0 - 255
        "min_fan_stop_speed": 25,   // When the fan is already spinning, this is the lowest speed at which the fan will continue spinning.
                                    // Range 0 - 255
        "min_fan_speed": 0,         // The speed at which the service will run the fan when the GPU temperature is less than or equal to min_temp_c.
                                    // Range 0 - 255. A value of 0 indicates that the fan will not spin
        "max_fan_speed": 200,       // The speed at which the service will run the fan when the GPU temperature is greater than or equal to max_temp_c.
                                    // Range 0 - 255.
        "average": 1,               // How many of the recent temperature readings are averaged to calculate the "current" temperature, used in fan speed calculations.
                                    // Not implemented.
    }
}
```
